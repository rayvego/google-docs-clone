## Introduction

This project is a real-time collaborative rich text editor built using a modern tech stack, ideal for collaborative document editing. The primary goal of this project was to explore Next.js and dive into real-time collaboration using Liveblocks.

## Tech Stack:

- Next.js
- Liveblocks
- Lexical
- Clerk
- Shadcn UI
- TypeScript
- React Hook Form
- Zod
- Sentry

## Key Features:

- Real-time Collaboration: Multiple users can edit the document simultaneously with Liveblocks.
- Clerk Authentication: Secure user login and registration.
- Rich Text Editing: Supports headings (H1-H3), bold, italics, alignment, and more using Lexical.
- Comments and Threads: Collaborators can leave comments and engage in discussions directly within the document.
- Mentions: Use "@" to mention specific users within comments and threads.
- Custom Notifications: Receive real-time notifications when documents are shared, you're mentioned, and more.
- Document Sharing: Easily share documents with others and manage their access permissions.
- Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on various devices.

## Project Background:

This project was followed along by a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/y5vE8y_f_OM?si=XSu8HaUfYW1d8OOj) and served as a hands-on learning experience to understand the intricacies of Liveblocks and real-time collaboration. The lessons learned here will be invaluable for my next major project, a **collaborative code editor**, built from _scratch_.
